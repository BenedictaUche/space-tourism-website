## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

- Integrating animations into the code can impact its behavior. After importing the animate.css library, the page dimensions noticeably increased. However, upon removing the imported animations, the pages reverted to their original width and height.



### Continued development

My focus will be on implementing dynamic routing, incorporating delightful animations, and implementing lazy loading for continued development.
